## Introduction

Computers can carry out an awesome amount of mathematics; we all know that. So how come all of this can be performed on a machine that can only add 1 and 1; no subtraction as we know it; no multiplication and no division? The answer is that an electronic adder circuit that just adds 1 + 1 and uses a few tricks of the binary system can, with some help from a little firmware code, carry out any arithmetic we need at an amazing speed. The simple electronic calculator circuit at the heart of this wizardry is known as the Half Adder and is shown, made from just a couple of logic gates (an Exclusive OR gate and an AND gate).
